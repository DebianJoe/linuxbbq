========

This is the "heavy construction" side of software development for the LinuxBBQ.  The possibility that these programs will break horribly is very high.

Main Branch
=======
The stable branch for the BBQTools can be found at https://github.com/machinebacon/linuxbbq and that is the best option for the time being to locate the scripts which are currently included in all LinuxBBQ releases.
